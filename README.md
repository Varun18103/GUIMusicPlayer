# GUI_Music_Player

"GUI Music Player" is a Python project that provides a user-friendly graphical interface for playing, pausing, and stopping music tracks. Built using pygame library, it allows users to load and control their favorite songs easily, enhancing their music listening experience.

Key features of the GUI Music Player project typically include:

User Interface: The application presents a visually appealing and intuitive graphical user interface where users can interact with the music player.

File Selection: Users can browse their computer's file system to select and add music files to the player's playlist. The player supports various audio file formats, such as MP3, WAV, and more.

Playlist Management: The player maintains a playlist of selected music files, allowing users to add, remove, and reorder tracks as desired. The playlist provides a convenient way to organize and access multiple songs.

Playback Controls: The music player offers controls for playing, pausing, stopping, skipping to the next or previous track, and adjusting the volume. Users can control the playback of the currently selected song.

Seek Functionality: Users can seek to a specific position in a track by dragging a seek bar or using dedicated buttons. This feature allows them to jump to any point in a song easily.

Display Song Information: The player may display essential information about the currently playing song, such as the title, artist, album, duration, and album artwork if available.

Repeat and Shuffle Modes: The player can support repeat and shuffle modes to enhance the listening experience. Users can choose to repeat a single track, repeat the entire playlist, or play tracks randomly.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts can be implemented to provide additional convenience and control over the music player. Users can use specific keys to perform common actions quickly.

The GUI Music Player project combines Python programming with GUI frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython to create an interactive and visually appealing music player experience.
